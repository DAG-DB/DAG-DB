# Learning directed acyclic graphs by backpropagation

This is the repo for the UCL Machine Learning MSc (2021-22) thesis by 
candidate RTSC3. It contains the DAG-DB framework for learning directed 
acyclic 
graphs (**DAG**s) by **D**iscrete **B**ackpropagation. 

## Abstract

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) occur in a wide range of contexts, including
project management, version control systems, evolutionary biology, and graphical
models. This thesis aims to learn DAGs from data using fully discrete backpropagation.

DAGs are very numerous, but the requirement for no cycles also makes them a
very small proportion of the wider set of all directed graphs. Nonetheless, the
problem of learning DAGs from associated data has been widely studied, and 
considerable
progress has been made, at least in the context of 'sparse' DAGs with relatively few
edges per node. Recently advances have been made in addressing this learning
problem by backpropagation. Typically, the problem is 'relaxed’ to a related continuous
problem in training. There are, however, a number of techniques for fully discrete
backpropagation which could be applied.

This thesis constructs DAG-DB, a framework for learning sparse DAGs from
data by fully Discrete Backpropagation. DAG-DB draws on the architecture used
in implicit maximum likelihood estimation (I-MLE)&nbsp;[[1]](#Bibliography),
and performs competitively
using either of two discrete backpropagation techniques, I-MLE itself, or 
straight-through estimation&nbsp;[[2, 3]](#Bibliography). 
This is demonstrated in experiments on selected synthetic
data, and on a real dataset. These experiments see DAG-DB mostly out-performing
the selected combinatoric methods. Its predictions are less good than those for the
best-known continuous optimisation methods, but it may be possible to 
narrow the
gap by further hyperparameter optimisation. An attraction of DAG-DB is that it
provides a way to incorporate layers with fully discrete digraph or DAG values into
wider neural networks.

## Installation

Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a conda environment 
DAG-DB in Python 3.10. 

I used the the Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon operating system, but any Linux (at 
least) should work.

As described in `code/README.md`, some experiments use clones of other repos:
- [`py-causal`](https://github.com/bd2kccd/py-causal)
- [NOTEARS](https://github.com/xunzheng/notears)
- [GOLEM](https://github.com/xunzheng/notears).

## Using DAG-DB

Go to './code' for `example.ipynb` and a README with further details.  The 
repo contents are as follows:

- `code/` project code, probably the first place to visit.  Includes more 
  detailed README.md for the code
- `data/` synthetic and real data used in the thesis
- `latents/` used by former in-model tracking option
- `logs/` log files from training
- `log_to_collate/` log files grouped together for processing results of 
  certain experiments
- `models/` to contain any saved models
- `results/` contains csv files with results from certain experiments
- `environment.yml` details of the Python 3.10 environment for DAG-DB
- `LICENCE`
- this `README.md`
- `requirements_for_cluster.txt` used only for running in the UCL computing 
  cluster.

## Acknowledgements

I am very grateful to my thesis supervisors, Dr Pasquale Minervini, 
Dr Valentina Zantedeschi and Dr Luca Franceschi.  They have all been immensely
enthusiastic and generous with their time.  I have benefited hugely from 
their guidance, perspective and challenge, very much enjoying our discussions.
I am grateful too to them for introducing me to a fascinating subject area.
My thanks also to Dr Pontus Stenetorp for taking on the formal sponsorship
of the project.
